# Static Deployment Solution

## Problem Solved
The deployment was failing because Vite was building files to `dist/public/` instead of directly to `dist/`, which caused the static deployment to look for `index.html` in the wrong location.

## Solution Implemented
Created `deploy-fix.js` which:
1. Runs the Vite build process in production mode
2. Automatically moves files from `dist/public/` to `dist/`
3. Removes any server-side files that shouldn't be in static deployment
4. Verifies the correct deployment structure

## How to Build for Deployment

### Quick Deploy (Recommended)
```bash
node deploy-fix.js
```

### Manual Process
If you need to run the steps manually:
```bash
# 1. Build the project
npx vite build --mode production

# 2. Move files to correct location
mv dist/public/* dist/
rmdir dist/public

# 3. Clean up server files
rm -f dist/index.js dist/index.js.map
```

## Verification
After running the build script, verify:
- ✅ `dist/index.html` exists
- ✅ `dist/assets/` contains CSS, JS, and image files
- ✅ No server-side files (`index.js`) are present
- ✅ All static assets have correct relative paths

## Current Structure
```
dist/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file
└── assets/            # Static assets
    ├── *.css          # Stylesheets
    ├── *.js           # JavaScript bundles
    └── *.png          # Images
```

The `dist/` directory is now ready for static deployment on any hosting platform.
