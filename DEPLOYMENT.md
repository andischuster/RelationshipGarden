# Deployment Guide for Relationship Garden

## Frontend Fixed! ðŸŽ‰

The frontend has been fixed and is now working properly. Here's what was changed:

### Issues Fixed:

1. **Build Output Path**: Changed the Vite build output from `dist/public` to `server/public` to match the backend's expectations.

2. **Asset Resolution**: The assets are now properly resolved using the `@assets` alias pointing to `attached_assets/`.

3. **Production Build**: The frontend now builds correctly for production deployment.

### Development Server

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- Backend server on port 5000 with Arize tracing
- Frontend served via Vite dev server
- All API endpoints working

### Production Build

To build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will:
- Build the frontend to `server/public/`
- Build the backend to `dist/`
- Include all assets with proper hashing

### Production Server

To run the production server:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production npm run start
```

This will serve the built frontend from `server/public/` and the backend API.

### For Render Deployment

1. Make sure to set these environment variables:
   - `ARIZE_SPACE_ID`
   - `ARIZE_API_KEY`  
   - `ARIZE_PROJECT_NAME`
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY`

2. Use the build command: `npm run build`

3. Use the start command: `npm run start`
