# Full-Stack Deployment Guide

## Problem Solved
The original static deployment was missing the backend API endpoints needed for the waiting list functionality and admin portal. This has been resolved with a complete full-stack deployment.

## Current Deployment Structure

```
dist/
├── index.js           # Express server with API endpoints
└── public/            # Frontend assets
    ├── index.html     # Main HTML file
    └── assets/        # CSS, JS, and images
        ├── index.css  # Compiled styles
        └── index.js   # Frontend application
```

## Features Included

### Backend API Endpoints
- `POST /api/preorders` - Add email to waiting list
- `GET /api/preorders` - View all preorders (admin)
- Database integration with PostgreSQL
- Error handling and validation

### Frontend Functionality
- Landing page with email signup
- Form validation
- API integration for waiting list
- Responsive design
- Admin portal access

## Deployment Commands

### Build for Production
```bash
# Build both frontend and backend
npm run build

# Or use the custom deployment script
node deploy-fix.js
```

### Start Production Server
```bash
npm start
```

This runs: `NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js`

### Verify Deployment
```bash
# Test API endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/preorders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com"}'

# Expected response:
{"success":true,"message":"Pre-order registered successfully!"}
```

## Environment Variables Required
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `NODE_ENV=production` - For production mode

## Deployment Status
✅ Backend server built and functional  
✅ API endpoints working correctly  
✅ Frontend serving properly  
✅ Database integration active  
✅ Email validation working  
✅ Admin portal accessible  

The full-stack deployment is now ready for production hosting that supports Node.js applications.
