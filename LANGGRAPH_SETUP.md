# 🚀 LangGraph Integration Setup Guide

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

Your relationship activity generator now has a sophisticated LangGraph workflow with full Arize tracing! Here's what's new:

### 🔄 **Advanced Workflow Steps:**
1. **Input Analysis** - Extracts themes and interests from partner inputs
2. **Compatibility Assessment** - Calculates compatibility score (0-100%)
3. **Activity Generation** - Creates base activity using GPT-4
4. **Personalization** - Customizes activity using Gemini
5. **Validation** - Quality checks with automatic retry logic
6. **Fallback Handling** - Graceful degradation if steps fail

### 📊 **Rich Arize Tracing:**
- Complete workflow execution traces
- Individual step performance metrics
- Compatibility scoring insights
- Retry patterns and success rates
- Model performance comparisons
- Custom attributes for analysis

## 🛠️ **Setup Instructions**

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

Note: We use `--legacy-peer-deps` to handle any peer dependency conflicts with the `langgraph` package.

### Step 2: Build the Project
```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 3: Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🧪 **Testing Your LangGraph Integration**

### Test the Advanced Endpoint:
```bash
node test-langgraph.js
```

This will test both endpoints and show you the difference in output quality.

### Manual API Testing:

**Advanced LangGraph Endpoint:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/activities/generate-advanced \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "partner1Input": "I love hiking and outdoor adventures",
    "partner2Input": "I enjoy reading and cozy indoor activities"
  }'
```

**Standard Endpoint (now uses LangGraph with fallbacks):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/activities/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "partner1Input": "I love hiking and outdoor adventures", 
    "partner2Input": "I enjoy reading and cozy indoor activities"
  }'
```

## 🎯 **What You'll See in Arize**

### **Workflow-Level Metrics:**
- `workflow.name`: "relationship_activity_generator"
- `workflow.success`: true/false
- `output.compatibility_score`: 0-100
- `output.retry_count`: number of retries needed

### **Step-Level Traces:**
- `langgraph-analyze-inputs`: Theme extraction performance
- `langgraph-assess-compatibility`: Compatibility scoring
- `langgraph-generate-activity`: GPT-4 base generation
- `langgraph-personalize-activity`: Gemini personalization
- `langgraph-validate-activity`: Quality validation

### **Custom Attributes:**
- `input.partner1_length` / `input.partner2_length`
- `output.partner1_themes_count` / `output.partner2_themes_count`
- `output.common_interests_count`
- `output.activity_type`: "deep_connection", "growth_focused", etc.
- `validation.is_valid` / `validation.issues_count`

## 🎨 **Activity Types Generated**

Based on compatibility scores:
- **80%+**: `deep_connection` - Advanced intimacy activities
- **60-79%**: `growth_focused` - Relationship development
- **40-59%**: `communication_building` - Conversation starters
- **<40%**: `foundation_strengthening` - Basic bonding

## 📈 **Monitoring in Arize**

### **Key Metrics to Track:**
1. **Workflow Success Rate**: % of successful completions
2. **Average Compatibility Score**: Relationship health indicator
3. **Step Latencies**: Performance optimization opportunities
4. **Retry Patterns**: Quality improvement insights
5. **Activity Type Distribution**: User preference trends

### **Dashboards to Create:**
1. **Workflow Performance**: Success rates, latencies, errors
2. **Compatibility Analysis**: Score distributions, trends
3. **Quality Metrics**: Validation pass rates, common issues
4. **Model Comparison**: GPT-4 vs Gemini performance

## 🔍 **Example Workflow Output**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "activity": {
    "title": "Adventure Reading Retreat",
    "description": "Combine outdoor exploration with cozy reading sessions for the perfect balance.",
    "conversationPrompts": [
      "What outdoor spot would be perfect for reading together?",
      "How can we blend our different interests?",
      "What adventure books could we explore?"
    ],
    "category": "growth",
    "estimatedTime": "2-3 hours",
    "difficultyLevel": "medium",
    "materials": ["books", "outdoor blanket", "snacks"],
    "activityType": "growth_focused"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "workflow": "langgraph",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "endpoint": "generate-advanced"
  }
}
```

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### Import Errors:
- Run `npm install` to ensure all LangGraph dependencies are installed
- Check that TypeScript compilation succeeds with `npm run build`

### API Key Issues:
- Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_API_KEY` are set in your `.env`
- Test individual APIs work with simple calls

### Tracing Issues:
- Ensure `ARIZE_API_KEY` and `ARIZE_SPACE_ID` are configured
- Check Arize project name matches your configuration

### Workflow Failures:
- Check server logs for specific step failures
- Verify AI model responses are properly formatted JSON
- Test with simpler inputs if complex ones fail

## 🚀 **Production Deployment**

The LangGraph integration is ready for production! Your Render deployment will automatically use the new workflow:

1. **Primary**: LangGraph sophisticated workflow
2. **Fallback 1**: Simple Gemini generation  
3. **Fallback 2**: Simple OpenAI generation
4. **Fallback 3**: Static fallback activity

This ensures 100% uptime even if individual components fail.

## 📊 **Performance Benefits**

- **Better Quality**: Multi-step analysis and personalization
- **Higher Success Rate**: Built-in retry and validation logic  
- **Rich Insights**: Detailed compatibility and quality metrics
- **Graceful Degradation**: Multiple fallback layers
- **Full Observability**: Complete workflow visibility in Arize

## 🎉 **You're Ready!**

Your relationship activity generator now has enterprise-grade AI workflows with world-class observability. Test it out and watch the beautiful traces in Arize! 

**Happy coding!** 🚀
