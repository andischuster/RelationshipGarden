    2. **Cultivate Connection:** Take turns drawing a card, reflect quietly, then share your heart. Let them know how it matters to you.
    3. **Sunflower Speak:** Use "I feel…" to shine light on your truth, not blame. Speak from the heart, and your partner will lean toward the warmth.
    4. **Let Love Bloom:** End each conversation on a positive: love, laughter, a thank you. Validation grows safety, even without perfect agreement.
    5. **Plant a Promise:** At the end of each session plant an intention. Write it, draw it, or say it aloud. and come back to see how it's blossomed.

### **Vibe**

- Pure mid-century modern children's book style
- Friendly and optimistic with bold, simple shapes
- Direct visual storytelling without unnecessary detail
- Classic picture book charm
- Feels like a storybook meets a modern tarot deck
- Balance between elegant and playful
- Think Bernice Myers and Joseph Levine's illustrations
- Style reference: Bold shapes, limited colors, and playful characters typical of 1950s-60s children's books. Clean compositions with plenty of white space and clear visual hierarchy. Inspired by the inky warmth of children’s storybook sketches — similar to mid-century naturalist drawings, but with cartoon charm.
